Really Amazing, just epic and awesome to watch, no other words.  A bold showing on the theory and practice of collective oligarchies. A consumerist masterpiece that shows the function of a capitalist world built off of cinema and film industry. In every moment the screen fills up with action, not only from the main character. It should win an Oscar for its screenplay. The amazing factors might be from the hyper filled fight scenes like Morbius and Milo, Or the magnificent plot. The plot involves a disabled man. Amazing plot right? Whoever thought this should be made deserves a medal. This is the best live action of the 21st century. Easily beats every movie in its path. This movie made me dedicated to my present job, being a Vampire. The antagonist is also a disabled man who lives trying to find a cure for his disease, Any person caught making the wrong face gets eliminated. the climax is the fellow Michael Morbius  coming in to save the day. after I watched it in the theater I felt something I had never felt before. Pure 100% joy. This film needs a follow-up ASAP. I have never in my life seen a better movie. The film's soundtrack consists of works better than the likes of Elton John, The Beatles, Queen, and any other group/solo artist(s). I felt like I was in the world of vampires with all the realistic details around the landscape. This movie grasps its audience and does not let go. The captivating story, the amazing music, the idea of the movie itself, the screenplay, landscape, atmosphere, random details from the comics, Easter eggs of the 3 Spider-Man like Tobey, Andrew, and Tom, all of those reasons mentioned are just SOME of why I love this movie. The trailer is fantastic, and I love Milo's dance during the middle of the movie with his montage! A critic's DREAM. We follow the main character through land after land, including Oscorp, Times-Square, Philadelphia, California, Brazil, Tokyo, Greenland, Great Britain, and so much more! They included guide maps for the places Morbius visits, to try and get us to visit the places! Some people say this is just a cash grab for an "unpopular" villain, and they are right. As a consumerist, I don't mind this! This movie is so enjoyable it feels as if you are flying to your happy place! 10/10. Would watch it again Morbillion times! A modern classic that in the future will be looked at as nostalgia! If you see this at the bargain bin, PLEASE, buy it. This movie is too good to look over. It's insane how the director can make this good of a movie! We need a Sequel, animated film, musical, a comedy film, everything! Watch this masterpiece, and you will agree with make. thank GOD for this movie! My emotions went insane for this movie! I can not believe how they made a movie about vampires turn into the entertainment powerhouse! I love vampires I want to be a vampire so much, I love it! Morbius is so cool I love it!  please let my family go hahaha. Morbius literally has so many stunning backgrounds it's amazing! I love Morbius movies so much! MORBIUS HAS SO MANY RELATABLE CHARACTERS I LOVE! #MORBIUSSWEEP #LETOSWEEP #MORBILLION TICKETS #MORBILLON BOX OFFICE
